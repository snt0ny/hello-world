The Snow Man<p>
<br>
One must have a mind of winter<p>
To regard the frost and the boughs<p>
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;<p>
<br>
And have been cold a long time<p>
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,<p>
The spruces rough in the distant glitter<p>
<br>
Of the January sun; and not to think<p>
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,<p>
In the sound of a few leaves,<p>
<br>
Which is the sound of the land<p>
Full of the same wind<p>
That is blowing in the same bare place<p>
<br>
For the listener, who listens in the snow,<p>
And, nothing himself, beholds<p>
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.<p>
<br>
-Wallace Stevens<p>
